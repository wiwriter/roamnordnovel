Roam Research theme for Fiction Writing


Welcome to my totally kludged together roam theme for fiction writing. I had never touched CSS when I started editing the orignal Nord theme and it shows.


I just did trial and error changes to it until I got a first line indent figured out. There's probably all sorts of junk in here that doesn't need to be.



If you ever figure out how to implement typewriter scrolling, please let me know!
